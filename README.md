An ongoing artistic exploration, involving the living minds and cross-disciplinary perspectives of young artists and researchers, in creative conversation with concepts of virtuality and virtual state of being. A composition of different artificial neural networks, generative systems and virtual technology.


Ode to the amour of our bodily senses and the realities we perceive through them. An entanglement between realities and dreams, physical body and metaphysical being, the limits of life and infinity of possibilities, of humans and beyondâ€¦

## AI
Palettes generated and painted by AI, based on an ancient romance imagined and written by human, transcribed into language perceivable to machine, to hallucinate this dreamy encounter between a man and a goddess, a disparate match destined to part ways...

A machine dreams, in repeat, of a love never meant to be
A human dreams, even disillusioned, still chooses to love

## Generative System

## XR
XR technology is used to set stage for this contemporary ritual, as each viewer and the virtual being will together compose an abstract duet.
 
These temporary experiences rendered in Augmented Reality would collectively form a continuous dialogue, channeling all individual encounters from different physical space, to the omnipresent virtuality beyond physical presence. For us all to explore the timeless question of what reality is and together dream what it could be.
